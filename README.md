# Accident-Alert-System
accident alert system project using arduino uno 
The Rapid growth of technology and infrastructure has made our lives easier. The 
advent of technology has also increased the traffic hazards and the road accidents take place 
frequently which causes huge loss of life and property because of the poor emergency facilities. 
Our project will provide an optimum solution to this draw back. According to this project, when 
a vehicle meets with an accident, the Micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) sensor will 
detect the signal and this signal will be analyzed by Arduino. The Arduino sends the alert 
message through the GSM Module including the location to police control room or a rescue 
team. So, the police can immediately trace the location through the GPS Module, after receiving 
the information. Then after confirming the location necessary action will be taken. The aim of 
this work is to automatically detect an accident and alert the nearest hospital or medical services 
about the exact location of the accident.
